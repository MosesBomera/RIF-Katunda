## Object Detection API Tutorial
This repository contains an end to end object detection tutorial i.e from the
data parsing and visualization, environment setup and TFRecords creation, and finally and
End to End training pipeline.

### Data Parsing and Visualization (Part One)
This notebook introduces the different annotation formats, conversion between formats
and finally visualizing of the dataset.

### Environment Setup and Creating TFRecords (Part Two)
In part two, the workspace set up is explored, and the process of creating TFRecords explained.

### An End to End Training Pipeline (Part Three)
Finally, we go through the end to end process, this notebook contains the concepts from the
first and second notebook and then introduces the training process from the creation of
TFRecords to model exportation.
